Canada saw a leap in job growth in April, adding approximately 259,000 jobs, which significantly reduced the unemployment rate from 7.5% to 7.2%. This data was reported by the country’s statistical agency, Statistics Canada. The increase in employment came largely from the private sector, with services-producing industries having majority of the rise. Despite this increase, the overall employment rate still remained short of pre-pandemic levels. However, the significant job growth has been a sign of economic recovery after the major hit caused by the COVID-19 pandemic.
